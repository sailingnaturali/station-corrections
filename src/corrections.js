 * A few kilometres is a plausibly botched coordinate. Past that you are
 * almost certainly pointing at a different place, which is the mistake this
 * catches: the correction lands in water, so `validatePositions` is happy,

 * Check each correction against the published station it claims to describe.

 * file cannot know: the published station list. Callers that have it (CI,
 * which already loads a stations file for `audit`) pass it in; those that do
 * not simply skip this check. That is the whole reason the corrections file
 * does not record the published position itself — duplicating upstream data
 * means carrying a copy that drifts silently the moment the provider moves a
 * gauge, and the lock already exists to make that move visible.
 *
 * Two checks, both needing the same lookup:
 *  - a corrected `position` is a plausible distance from the published one
 *    (a fix, not a relocation);
 *  - a curated `name` shares at least one meaningful word with the published
 *    name. This is the issue #6 bug: `name: Anacortes` curated onto a
 *    Swinomish Channel gauge, a station that is not Anacortes and shares no
 *    word with it. A curated name replaces the source name outright, so
 *    nothing else would ever catch it being attached to the wrong station.
 *
 * Stations absent from `stations` are skipped rather than reported. A caller
 * may legitimately validate against a partial list (tides but not currents),
 * and an orphan warning there would be noise, not a finding.
 *
 * Malformed positions are skipped — `validateCorrections` reports those.
