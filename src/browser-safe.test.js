/**
 * The package root must reach no Node builtin.
 *
 * This is the regression test for a real outage: `createBundledResolver` used
 * `node:fs` and `node:url`, a bundler externalized them to stubs, and the
 * first call threw `fileURLToPath is not a function` — blanking
 * slackwater.sailingnaturali.com with nothing in the console pointing here.
 *
 * The existing public-surface test proves the exports *exist*; this one
 * proves the root can actually *run* somewhere without a filesystem. It walks
 * the static import graph rather than executing anything, because the failure
 * was a build-time externalization, not a runtime branch — the offending
 * import is visible in the source, and catching it there needs no browser.
 *
 * Anything that genuinely needs Node (the CLI, the audit chain, the build
 * scripts) lives outside this graph and is unaffected.
