 * entry has no upstream to differ from - it is the record itself. CHS is the
 * first data like this: the name a consumer sees is a hand-written label, and
 * the fitting pipeline emits no position at all.
 *
 * Deliberately imports no coastline: position-in-water checking lives behind
 * ./validate-positions.js so the package root stays cheap.
