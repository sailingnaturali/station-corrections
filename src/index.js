/**
 * Build a resolver over the corrections and gazetteer this package ships.
 *
 * The data arrives as JSON import attributes rather than `readFileSync`, so
 * this module reaches no Node builtin and works unchanged in a browser
 * bundle. It used to read the files off disk; in a bundler `node:url` gets
 * externalized to a stub and the first call threw `fileURLToPath is not a
 * function`, blanking the consuming app with nothing pointing back here.
 * `src/browser-safe.test.js` fails if a Node builtin becomes reachable again.
 *
 * `data/corrections.json` is compiled from the YAML for exactly this reason —
 * a browser cannot read a file off disk, and every runtime can import JSON.
 * See `scripts/build-corrections-json.mjs`.
 *
 * Both files are a few KB and load eagerly with this module. The data kept
 * deliberately out of reach is the 3.6 MB coastline, which lives behind
 * ./audit.js and ./validate-positions.js and is never imported from here.
