/**
 * Type-level twin of src/public-surface.test.js.
 *
 * That test proves the exports exist at runtime; this one proves the shipped
 * declarations describe them correctly. It is checked by `tsc --noEmit`, not
 * executed — the point is that it compiles.
 *
 * Written the way a consumer writes it, because the bug this guards against
 * is exactly what happened in slackwater-web: a hand-written ambient
 * declaration that drifted from the real API with nothing to catch it.
